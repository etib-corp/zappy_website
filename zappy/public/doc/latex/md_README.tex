We had 5 weeks to make an entire simulation based on rules set by Epitech. In this project, we were 6 persons working on it.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Network side
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Léo Sautron
\item Nathan Maillot This part of the project was restricted by without using threads and sub-\/process.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Artificial Intelligence
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Noah Lagrange Bacary
\item Cédric Roulof Here, we were faced with algorithms, and understanding of AI actually.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Graphical User Interface
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Julien Ferdinand (Open\+GL handling)
\item Benjamin Lauret (UI/\+UX)
\item Léo Sautron (Open\+GL handling)
\item Nathan Maillot (UI/\+UX and architecture) The main goal was to make a cosy User Interface, user-\/friendly, and full of informations.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Special thanks to Raphaël Turpin, who help us on Open\+GL and VR implementation (thanks God).\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Context}{Context}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You are on a planet named {\bfseries{Amber}}.
\item The natives of this planet is the {\bfseries{Trantotians}}.
\item A {\bfseries{Trantorians}} belongs to {\bfseries{teams}} (as {\itshape tribes}).
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{The Trantorians}{The Trantorians}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md10}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Each Trantorian have an inventory.
\item They can \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape move} and rotate themselves.
\item {\itshape lay eggs}.
\item {\itshape take} items dropped on the floor.
\item {\itshape drop} items on the floor.
\item {\itshape see} in front of them.
\item {\itshape eject} other Trantorians from their positions.
\item {\itshape make sound} that allow them to {\bfseries{communicate}} with other Trantorians.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Trantorians have to {\bfseries{level up}}.
\item The first team with {\bfseries{6}} Trantorians at the {\bfseries{8th}} level win.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Limitations}{Limitations}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md12}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Each action that a Trantorian can do costs time units.
\item Trantorians eat 1 food each 126 time units.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If they can\textquotesingle{}t eat, they die.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Amber Server}{Amber Server}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md13}
We called the server Amber, because in the lore, Trantorians can take stuff from the floor, and these things are mainly stones. So it just was logic to call the server by a stone name. (and admit that is a cool name)

This side will manages the world logic, all the actions will be executed here. Here we manage all connections and the behaviour of the world.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Turing AI}{Turing AI}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md14}
I think I don\textquotesingle{}t have to explain why we called our AI like this...

So basically, our AI is based on multiple things, we made a strategy\+:\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Level 1}{Level 1}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md15}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We have a mother AI
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item She aims at level up.
\item If it can\textquotesingle{}t level up, she will find food.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Level 2}{Level 2}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md16}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The mother AI
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If she is starving, she creates a child who suicides, and then collect his food.
\item If she is alone on her case, she makes a child which stay with her and try to level up.
\item If she doesn\textquotesingle{}t have a child collector, she makes one and his goal is to collect items needed by the mother.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

For the next levels, the logic stay the same as the second level\textquotesingle{}s one.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Onyx}{Onyx}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md17}
As you know, we called our server Amber, and we searched a named for the GUI, and \doxylink{namespaceOnyx}{Onyx} is as cool as Amber for a stone name.

So, get ready there are many things...\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{3\+D rendering}{3D rendering}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md18}
We used Open\+GL to represent the world, it\textquotesingle{}s a great stack to use in C++, and we just love the way it works. It was not really an objective choice.

So we made many things to improve the UX\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Animations on Trantorians.
\item Camera moving.
\item Optimisation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

It seems like there is not so many things, but we made many optimisations (field of view, partial rendering on 3D objects).

All the code was made from scratch. The only library used to simplify our life during the project is {\itshape assimp}.

For the rendering, we have integrated Open\+GL to our personnal Game Engine, the Etib Game Engine (EGE).\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{User Interface}{User Interface}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md19}
For the user interface, we choose an open source API {\itshape Im\+GUI}.

We worked on a user-\/friendly interface by making a tutorial which drive you through the software. All the usefull informations of the world is displayed on differents panel.

But can also customize your experience in the app by changing the mouse sensivity for example. And you can interact with the world to see all the informations you need.

In our Game Engine, we have also integrated Im\+Gui for a easier use for developpement. By making interfaces and simplify the use of it thanks to the GUIManager we made.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Documentation}{Documentation}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md20}
