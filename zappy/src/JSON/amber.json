This planet, named Zappy, becomes the arena for an intense competition between various human and alien factions, each striving to exploit the planet's resources to gain a strategic advantage. The game takes place on a grid representing the surface of the planet Zappy. Players need to move around, gather resources, build structures, and interact with other players (both allies and enemies).
